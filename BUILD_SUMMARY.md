# Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit - Build Summary

## Project Structure

The Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit has been successfully built with the following structure:

### Packages

1. **@saaskit/multitenancy-core** (`packages/core/`)
   - Core tenant context management using AsyncLocalStorage
   - Express middleware for tenant resolution (subdomain, header, token, custom)
   - TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Role and permission middleware

2. **@saaskit/multitenancy-adapters** (`packages/adapters/`)
   - Prisma adapter with automatic query filtering
   - Sequelize hooks and model integration
   - Mongoose plugin for tenant isolation

3. **@saaskit/multitenancy-auth** (`packages/auth/`)
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) with RoleManager
   - Attribute-based access control (ABAC) with PolicyEngine
   - Unified AuthorizationManager

### Example Application

- **Express Demo** (`examples/express-demo/`)
  - Demonstrates subdomain-based tenant resolution
  - JWT authentication
  - RBAC and ABAC authorization examples
  - Mock data store implementation

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Tenant Context Management**
- AsyncLocalStorage-based context propagation
- Multiple resolution strategies (subdomain, header, token, custom)
- Automatic context cleanup

✅ **ORM Integrations**
- Prisma: Middleware-based filtering
- Sequelize: Hook-based filtering
- Mongoose: Plugin-based filtering

✅ **Authorization System**
- Pre-defined roles (admin, member, viewer)
- Permission hierarchy support
- Policy-based access control
- Context-aware authorization decisions

✅ **Developer Experience**
- Full TypeScript support
- Modular architecture
- Framework agnostic core
- Comprehensive documentation

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies in the root
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run the example
cd examples/express-demo
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

To complete the toolkit:

1. **Add Tests**: Set up Jest testing framework with unit and integration tests
2. **CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and publishing
3. **More Examples**: Add NestJS and Fastify examples
4. **Advanced Features**: 
   - Tenant lifecycle management utilities
   - JWT integration helpers
   - Caching layer for performance
   - Multi-database support

## Architecture Highlights

The toolkit follows a modular, plugin-based architecture:

- **Core**: Provides the foundation with context management
- **Adapters**: Integrate with specific ORMs/ODMs
- **Auth**: Handles authorization logic
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new adapters or features

Each package is independently versioned and can be used standalone or together.
