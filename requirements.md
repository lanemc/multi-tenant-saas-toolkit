Product Requirements Document: Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit

1. Introduction and Overview
   Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit is an open-source library designed to simplify the implementation of multi-tenancy in web applications. It provides a standardized, flexible toolkit for partitioning and managing data for multiple customer organizations (tenants) within a single application instance. By offering out-of-the-box support for tenant isolation, context management, and access control, this toolkit aims to eliminate the need for developers to “reinvent the wheel” or build custom multi-tenancy solutions from scratch. The initial target environment is Node.js/TypeScript, with planned integrations for popular ORMs (Prisma, Sequelize, Mongoose) and built-in support for common authentication/authorization patterns. Future iterations may extend support to Python frameworks and ORMs, ensuring cross-platform utility.
   1.1 Problem Statement (Pain Points)
   Building a secure and robust multi-tenant architecture from scratch is tedious and error-prone. Many developers report having to cobble together ad-hoc solutions because no standard toolkit exists in the Node or Python ecosystems
   reddit.com
   reddit.com
   . This DIY approach can lead to inconsistent implementations, messy code, and potential security vulnerabilities. A common risk is data leakage between tenants if isolation is not implemented correctly – weak partitioning in a multi-tenant database can inadvertently expose one tenant’s data to another
   qrvey.com
   . Without a dedicated toolkit, developers must manually enforce tenant segregation at every layer (database queries, caching, file storage, etc.), increasing the chances of oversight and breaches. In summary, the lack of a standardized multi-tenancy library creates pain points in development speed, code maintainability, and application security.
   1.2 Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
   There are few open-source libraries for multi-tenancy in Node.js or Python, leaving a notable gap. Developers often stitch together their own boilerplate or sample code found online
   reddit.com
   , as community discussions highlight how hard it is to find any robust multi-tenancy boilerplate in Node/Python
   reddit.com
   . While other ecosystems offer mature solutions (for example, Laravel’s stancl/tenancy package in PHP provides flexible multi-database or single-database tenancy with automatic context switching
   tenancyforlaravel.com
   , and .NET has Finbuckle.MultiTenant for middleware-based tenant resolution and data isolation
   github.com
   ), the Node/Python world lacks an equivalently comprehensive toolkit. Some niche projects exist (e.g. small GitHub samples or unofficial libraries
   reddit.com
   ), but none have become a de facto standard. This fragmentation means Node/Python developers must either use full frameworks with opinionated multi-tenant support or implement it themselves – neither of which is ideal when striving for a quick, reliable SaaS MVP.
   1.3 Solution Concept
   Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit addresses these gaps by providing a drop-in library that developers can integrate into their existing Node.js applications (with minimal code changes) to enable multi-tenancy. Key aspects of the solution include:
   Transparent Tenant Context Management: Middleware and context utilities to automatically identify the tenant from each request (via subdomain, request headers, or authentication tokens) and make this context available throughout the app lifecycle.
   Automated Data Partitioning: Wrappers around ORM/ODM queries (Prisma, Sequelize, Mongoose, etc.) to enforce tenant separation – e.g. automatically appending tenant filters (tenant IDs) to queries or routing to tenant-specific database/schema. This ensures each tenant’s data is isolated and inaccessible to others by default.
   Role-Based and Attribute-Based Access Control: Built-in support for RBAC and ABAC within the multi-tenant context, so developers can easily enforce that users only access authorized data
   qrvey.com
   . For instance, only members of a tenant can access that tenant’s records, and roles/permissions can further restrict operations (e.g. an “admin” role can invite users to their tenant, a “user” role cannot).
   Tenant Onboarding & Management Utilities: High-level APIs to streamline common multi-tenant tasks – creating a new tenant organization, provisioning initial resources (e.g. default roles or data partitions), inviting or managing users in a tenant, and possibly handling subdomain registration for tenants.
   Integration with Authentication Providers: Pre-built connectors or recipes for integrating with popular auth providers (Auth0, Okta, Firebase Auth, etc.) to map authenticated users to tenant contexts. For example, if using Auth0 Organizations or custom JWT claims for tenant IDs, the toolkit will provide a plug-and-play middleware to extract and trust this information.
   Developer Experience Focus: The toolkit is designed to be flexible and unobtrusive – it can be added to an existing tech stack as an npm package, without requiring a separate service deployment. It will offer clear documentation, TypeScript type definitions for ease of integration, and sensible defaults that cover most use cases while allowing configuration for edge cases.
   By providing these features in a cohesive library, the toolkit lets developers support multiple customer organizations (tenants) out-of-the-box in their applications, drastically reducing the effort and risk involved compared to ad-hoc implementations. The ultimate goal is to empower developers to build SaaS applications that are multi-tenant from day one (or retrofit multi-tenancy into existing apps) with confidence that data isolation and security are handled by a well-tested, community-vetted solution.
2. Product Goals and Objectives
   Goal: Deliver a comprehensive multi-tenancy library for Node.js that is easy to integrate, secure, and flexible enough to fit various application needs. The toolkit should simplify the development of SaaS applications that serve multiple organizations, handling the heavy lifting of tenant isolation and access control while remaining agnostic to the application’s business logic. Key objectives include:
   Ease of Integration: A developer can enable multi-tenancy in an app with minimal configuration – e.g. by installing the library, adding an Express/NestJS middleware for tenant resolution, and annotating or configuring models for tenant scope. The library should fit into existing stacks (Express, NestJS, Fastify, etc., with ORM/ODM like Prisma, Sequelize, Mongoose) without forcing a rewrite. It will not require running a separate service or infrastructure; it’s a code library you include in your app (no external deployment needed).
   Robust Data Isolation: Guarantee that data from one tenant cannot be accessed by another. The toolkit will enforce this at the data access layer automatically. By providing a reliable partition mechanism (tenant ID filters, separate schema/DB connections, etc.), we prevent accidental cross-tenant data leakage – a critical security requirement
   qrvey.com
   . The implementation should make it practically impossible for a developer to retrieve or modify another tenant’s data unless explicitly using an override (for admin purposes).
   Security and Compliance: Incorporate security best practices for multi-tenant systems – each request is executed in a tenant-aware context with proper authorization checks (RBAC/ABAC). The library’s defaults will encourage or enforce patterns that mitigate common risks in multi-tenant apps (e.g. strict data partitioning, least privilege access, audit logging hooks for tenant admin actions). By embedding security at every layer of the multi-tenant architecture, the toolkit helps maintain customer trust and compliance

   qrvey.com
   .
   Flexibility & Customization: Support different multi-tenancy models as needed. Initially, the focus is on single application + single database (shared DB with tenant-separated data) as it’s most common for early-stage SaaS, but the design should allow extending to other models. For example, the toolkit could later support single application + multiple databases (each tenant on its own DB) or even hybrid approaches. It should also allow customization of tenant identification (not every app will use subdomains; some may use an X-Tenant-ID header or an OAuth claim) and be configurable to work with various authentication schemes. The library will come with sane defaults but not be overly prescriptive – developers can override behaviors (for instance, define custom logic for tenant resolution, or opt out of certain features if not needed).
   Comprehensiveness in MVP: The first version (MVP) of the toolkit should deliver all core functionalities – tenant context, data partitioning, ORM integrations, access control scaffolding, and basic tenant management – so that a developer’s minimum viable product can fully support multi-tenancy without further custom development. We aim for a “batteries included” approach where the most important features are available out-of-the-box in v1.0. (The product is planned as open source with a permissive license, allowing community adoption and feedback. An open-core model may be considered later, where advanced enterprise features or support are commercial, but the core library remains free and open.)
3. User Personas and Use Cases
   The primary users of the Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit are software developers / architects building SaaS or enterprise applications that will serve multiple organizational clients. Below are typical use cases and scenarios illustrating how the toolkit will be used:
   SaaS Startup Developer: Alice is building a B2B SaaS web application in Node.js (Express + Prisma) and needs to support multiple companies as tenants. Using the toolkit, she can enable multi-tenancy in days instead of weeks. She uses the provided middleware to identify tenants by subdomain (e.g. companyA.myapp.com, companyB.myapp.com) and the Prisma integration to ensure all database queries are automatically filtered by the tenant ID. She also leverages the toolkit’s role-based access control to differentiate between normal users and admin users within each tenant for certain features (like billing or user management). This allows Alice to launch her MVP with confidence that each customer’s data is isolated and secure, without having to deeply research multi-tenant patterns herself.
   Enterprise Platform Architect: Bob is integrating the toolkit into a larger platform that serves internal business units as tenants (multi-tenancy isn’t just for external SaaS; even internal platforms can have tenants). The application uses NestJS with TypeORM and Bob wants to enforce that each department (tenant) can only access its own records. Bob uses the toolkit’s database adapters to route database connections based on tenant (configuring separate schemas for each department), and sets up the ABAC module to define fine-grained policies (for example, certain sensitive records are only accessible to users with a clearance attribute). This ensures compliance with internal data segregation policies. Bob also appreciates the library’s ability to plug into their corporate SSO (which provides a tenant context via a JWT claim), making integration with Azure AD seamless.
   Full-Stack Engineer (Mid-stage SaaS): Carol is tasked with retrofitting multi-tenancy into an existing single-tenant Node application. Instead of refactoring everything manually, she introduces the toolkit. She defines a Tenant model and migrates existing data to include tenant IDs. With the toolkit’s help, Carol adds a middleware that reads the tenant from the logged-in user’s profile (their JWT includes an organization ID) and loads the tenant context. She uses the Mongoose integration for their MongoDB models to automatically scope queries by tenant. After integrating, Carol uses the provided testing utilities to simulate requests from different tenants ensuring no data leaks between tenants. The process is much faster and less error-prone than writing custom filters across the codebase.
   DevOps Engineer / SaaS Ops: Although not a direct code user, a DevOps engineer like Dan benefits from the toolkit because it standardizes how tenancy is handled. For example, if each tenant had a separate database, the toolkit could provide a consistent way to manage migrations across all tenant databases. Dan can use the toolkit’s admin scripts to list all tenants and run an upgrade routine for each. If an issue arises where a tenant is experiencing an error, having a central toolkit means there’s a known pattern to how tenants are separated, making debugging easier (e.g. all tenant-specific logs are tagged by tenant ID via toolkit’s logging hooks, etc.).
   These personas illustrate that the toolkit is aimed at developers and architects who need a reliable foundation for multi-tenancy. It abstracts repetitive and tricky parts of tenant management, letting developers focus on core application logic for their users.
4. Feature Requirements
   This section outlines the major features and requirements of the Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit. Each feature is described in terms of functionality and technical considerations.
   4.1 Tenant Identification & Context Management
   Description: Mechanisms to identify which tenant a given request or operation is associated with, and to make that context easily accessible throughout the application’s execution flow.
   Tenant Resolution Middleware: The toolkit will provide middleware for common web frameworks (Express, Koa, NestJS, Fastify) that executes at the start of a request to resolve the tenant. This could be done via:
   Subdomain Parsing: e.g. tenantName.myapp.com – the middleware extracts tenantName and looks up the corresponding tenant record.
   URL Path or Header: e.g. requests contain an X-Tenant-ID header or a URL prefix like /tenant/{tenantId}/.... The middleware can be configured to pull from different locations based on the app’s routing scheme.
   Auth Token Claims: e.g. a JWT includes a tenant_id or similar field. The middleware will decode the token (in cooperation with an auth library) and retrieve the tenant identifier.
   The resolved tenant ID (and optionally tenant metadata like name, plan, etc.) is then stored in a thread-local context (using Node’s AsyncLocalStorage or an equivalent mechanism) so that deeper in the call stack, other components (like the ORM) can access the current tenant easily. This approach mirrors patterns in other frameworks where a request-scoped context carries information like user and tenant. If the request’s tenant cannot be resolved (e.g. unknown domain or missing token), the middleware can throw an error or redirect to a default route (configurable behavior).
   Flexible Tenant Resolution Strategies: The toolkit should allow developers to customize how tenants are identified. For example, if using subdomains, a developer can provide the domain pattern; if using headers, the header name can be configured. We will support hooking custom resolution logic as well – e.g. if determining tenant from an API key or doing a database lookup to map a custom domain to a tenant. The goal is to accommodate different SaaS routing patterns (including B2C scenarios where a “tenant” might be derived from user identity in a certain way).
   Context Propagation: Once the tenant is identified at request entry, the toolkit ensures this tenant context propagates to all subsequent operations. Technically, with AsyncLocalStorage, we create a store for each request where we set context.tenantId = <ID>. Any code can retrieve the current tenant ID via a provided helper (e.g. TenantContext.currentTenant()), without needing to pass the tenant ID through every function. This simplifies integration with ORMs and other services (they can call TenantContext.currentTenant() internally).
   The context may also carry additional info, like the current authenticated user and their roles within the tenant (if the auth integration provides that). This way, both who and which tenant are known globally.
   The context is cleared at the end of the request to avoid any leakage across requests (especially important in serverless or multi-thread environments – though in Node each request has its own event loop context with our mechanism).
   Multi-Tenancy in Background Processes: The toolkit will consider non-HTTP contexts as well. For instance, if using message queues, cron jobs, or other asynchronous tasks that need to run per tenant. We plan to offer utilities to run functions in the context of a specified tenant. E.g. a function runWithTenant(tenantId, callback) that sets up the context for that tenant and executes the callback. This is useful for jobs that need to process data for each tenant in turn, or for writing test cases that simulate different tenant accesses. Similar capabilities are seen in other multi-tenant frameworks (Laravel’s tenancy package allows running commands for each tenant, etc.).
   Security Considerations: Tenant resolution is the front-line of multi-tenant security. The toolkit must ensure that this process is tamper-proof. For example, if relying on headers or tokens, it should integrate with authentication such that we trust the tenant info only from verified sources (e.g. from a JWT issued by our auth provider, not from a random client header that could be spoofed). If subdomains are used, wildcard DNS and routing need to be configured by the app developer; our library can provide guidance but not handle DNS. We will include documentation on securely configuring tenant resolution and warn against pitfalls (like trusting user input without validation). Additionally, if a tenant is identified but, say, the user is not actually a member of that tenant, the toolkit should detect this mismatch (likely via the auth integration or a lookup) and refuse access – preventing horizontal privilege escalation by switching tenant IDs.
   Acceptance Criteria: Developers can plug in the tenant resolution middleware and successfully see that requests are tagged with the correct tenant. In a sample app, logging TenantContext.currentTenant() within a controller or service should yield the expected tenant ID for that request. If a request comes in for a tenant that does not exist or the tenant cannot be determined, the app should respond with a clear error (HTTP 400 or 404, configurable). The context should not bleed across requests (verified by concurrent requests tests).
   4.2 Data Isolation & ORM/Database Integration
   Description: Tools to automatically partition data by tenant at the persistence layer. This includes ensuring that all database queries and transactions are executed within the scope of a tenant. The toolkit will integrate with popular ORMs/ODMs to inject tenant criteria or route to tenant-specific collections. This is the core of preventing data leakage between tenants.
   Tenant-Aware ORM Queries: For ORMs like Prisma and Sequelize (SQL databases) and Mongoose (MongoDB), provide integration such that any query on a tenant-scoped model automatically includes a filter by the current tenant. Possible approaches:
   For Prisma (a TypeScript ORM for relational DBs): Prisma allows middleware on queries (via prisma.$use). We will supply a middleware that intercepts queries to certain models/tables marked as multi-tenant and add a WHERE tenant_id = X clause using the current tenant ID from context. For example, if a developer has a Project model that is tenant-specific, any prisma.project.findMany() would transparently include where: { tenantId: currentTenantId }. We might require the schema to have a field (e.g. tenantId) on such models. The toolkit could include a convention or configuration for which field denotes the tenant key (default tenantId). If a query already specifies a tenant condition, the middleware can validate it matches the current context (to prevent accidental or intentional cross-tenant queries).
   For Sequelize (a popular ORM for Node): Sequelize supports adding scopes or default hooks. The toolkit can define a global model scope that applies tenantId filtering. Alternatively, we might provide base model classes or a plugin that, when applied, modifies model definitions to always include tenant criteria. For instance, a developer could extend a MultiTenantModel class for their entities, which in its beforeFind hook injects tenantId. We will explore both patterns (explicit inheritance vs implicit global hook) and likely offer the more intuitive one. The integration should also handle multi-tenant writes – e.g. automatically set the tenantId field on create operations for models, so developers don’t have to manually set it each time.
   For Mongoose (MongoDB ODM): We can use Mongoose middleware (pre-find, pre-save, etc.) or a discriminator approach. As noted by developers, one approach is using a discriminator key to segregate documents by tenant
   reddit.com
   . Our toolkit might provide a Mongoose plugin that, given a schema, adds a tenantId field (if not already) and ensures all queries are appended with { tenantId: currentTenantId }. Alternatively, for those who prefer separate collections per tenant in Mongo, the toolkit could facilitate that by dynamically constructing model names per tenant (though that can lead to many collections, which might be less desirable for many tenants). Initially, the simpler single-collection-with-tenant-field approach is likely.
   Single vs Multiple Database Support: The MVP will primarily support the shared database, tenant-per-row model (single DB with a tenant column in each table/collection). However, our design will keep in mind future support for multiple databases or schemas:
   Multiple Schemas (PostgreSQL): We could allow a mode where each tenant’s data resides in a separate schema within the same database. The toolkit would then switch the database schema on a per-request basis (some ORMs allow schema switching dynamically). For example, with Prisma or raw SQL, one could set the search_path (Postgres) to <tenant_schema> for each request’s connection. The toolkit might provide helpers to manage creation of schemas for new tenants in this mode.
   Multiple Database Instances: A more isolated approach is separate DB per tenant. The toolkit can manage a mapping from tenant -> DB connection string. On each request, it would use the appropriate connection. For ORMs, this could mean instantiating a separate ORM client per tenant or using a connection manager. This is more complex (especially if there are many tenants), but some apps require it for compliance or scaling reasons. While full support for this might be beyond MVP, the architecture should not preclude it. We will design an interface for “TenantDataStore” that could be implemented either as a simple filter (single DB mode) or as a dynamic connection selector (multi DB mode). This sets the stage for adding multi-db in a later version without breaking changes.
   In all modes, data isolation is paramount. Even in single-DB mode, we enforce that every query has a tenant condition. In multi-DB mode, we ensure that connections are not shared incorrectly. We will include test cases to simulate that no data from tenant A ever appears for tenant B under normal operation.
   Database Migrations & Setup: The toolkit will recommend or include patterns for migrating database schema in a multi-tenant environment. In single-DB mode, migrations are global (since one schema). In multi-schema or multi-DB modes, migrations need to be run for each tenant’s schema. While building a full migration tool is out-of-scope for core library, we will provide guidance or scripts to apply migrations tenant-wise. For example, if using Prisma migrate, one might run it once per tenant database (perhaps using the toolkit’s list of tenants). An advanced feature for future might be automating this by hooking into migration commands.
   Query Interface and Overrides: While automatic scoping is helpful, there may be scenarios where cross-tenant queries are needed (for instance, an admin dashboard that aggregates data across tenants, or an internal operation that accesses the central metadata of all tenants). The toolkit should allow explicit overrides when necessary:
   For example, perhaps a method like Toolkit.queryAllTenants(model, actualQuery) that can run a query without tenant filter (likely requiring an elevated privilege flag to use, to avoid misuse).
   Alternatively, developers could temporarily disable the tenant middleware (with caution) or run code outside of a tenant context. We might implement a check that if code is running without a tenant context, it cannot accidentally fetch tenant-scoped models (so as to avoid unintentional context leakage).
   Performance Considerations: Adding tenant filters to every query will add a slight overhead, but it’s generally just an indexed parameter in queries (assuming tenantId is indexed, which we will strongly recommend or enforce). This is a necessary trade-off for security. We will ensure the overhead in our middleware is minimal (the context lookup is O(1) and adding a filter is quick). For bulk operations affecting many rows, the overhead is negligible compared to the operation itself. The toolkit should be able to handle large numbers of tenants and data volumes as long as underlying DB is designed for it (e.g. proper indexing, partitioning if needed). For extreme scale (multi-tenant with millions of tenants), more complex strategies might be needed (like Citus for Postgres sharding by tenant, etc.), but those are beyond MVP scope. Our initial target is tens to hundreds of tenants on a single DB which is common for B2B SaaS startups.
   Transactional Integrity: We need to ensure that multi-tenant context works within transactions. E.g., if using a SQL transaction across multiple operations, the tenant filter should persist. If a developer starts a transaction (through ORM or raw), our toolkit should not accidentally allow adding a different tenant’s data into that transaction. This likely means the transaction is bound to the same tenant context (which it will, if context is global). We should document that cross-tenant transactions are not allowed (and if truly needed, they must be done very explicitly outside the normal API).
   NoSQL / Other Stores: Beyond SQL and Mongo, consider that apps might use caches like Redis, or ElasticSearch, etc. The toolkit’s primary focus is the primary database, but for completeness, we will mention data isolation in other layers:
   Cache: If the app uses a shared cache (Redis, Memcached) for multiple tenants, keys should be namespaced per tenant. The toolkit can provide a simple wrapper for cache clients that automatically prefixes keys with the tenant ID, to avoid data collision. E.g., cache.get("stats") becomes internally get("<tenantId>:stats"). Laravel’s package does something similar by separating cache stores per tenant
   tenancyforlaravel.com
   . This might be a bonus feature in MVP if time permits, or at least documented practice.
   File Storage: For apps storing files (images, uploads) on S3 or disk, we should encourage directory or key prefix per tenant as well. Possibly provide an interface to get a tenant-specific file storage path or bucket.
   Search/Analytics: If using a shared search index or analytics store, the toolkit can’t enforce that on an external system, but again naming or index-per-tenant strategies should be documented.
   Acceptance Criteria: In a demo application using the toolkit:
   If a developer queries a tenant-scoped model without explicitly filtering by tenant, the toolkit’s integration ensures only records for the current tenant are returned. E.g., Product.findAll() returns products for tenant A when the request’s tenant is A, and nothing from tenant B. This can be verified by seeding two tenants with data and calling the same code in each context – results should differ correctly.
   Attempts to intentionally bypass the filter (without using an official override) should fail or throw an error. For example, if a developer tries Prisma.queryRaw("SELECT \* FROM products") within a tenant context, perhaps our middleware can detect the absence of tenantId clause and prevent it (this is tricky for raw queries, but at least we document the risk).
   Creating new records automatically attaches the tenantId of the current context; e.g. new Order({...}).save() results in that Order row having the tenantId set to the current tenant. If a developer forgets to set it, the toolkit should set it.
   All automated tests for data isolation pass: no data from one tenant shows up in another tenant’s queries, even under concurrent load or complex query patterns.
   4.3 Tenant-Based Access Control (RBAC & ABAC)
   Description: Built-in support for managing user access within tenants, including role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). This feature ensures that even within a single tenant’s data, users have appropriate permissions, and across tenants, isolation is maintained not just at the data layer but also at the action/feature layer.
   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The toolkit will define a simple yet flexible RBAC system scoped to each tenant. This likely includes:
   A set of roles per tenant (e.g. Admin, Member, Manager, etc.). The toolkit might provide a default set (Admin and User as a basic starting point), but allow customization.
   Association of users to roles within each tenant. For example, user X might be an “Admin” in Tenant A but just a “Member” in Tenant B. The data model for this could be something like a join table or map (if the app manages users and tenants in a SQL DB, an associative table linking user_id, tenant_id, role). If using an external identity provider that supports roles or groups, we might integrate with that (for instance, Auth0 allows roles or Okta groups which can be tenant-specific).
   Permission checking APIs: The toolkit should offer a convenient way to check permissions. For instance, a decorator or function such as requireRole("Admin") for route handlers, which will ensure the current user (from context) has that role in the current tenant, otherwise return 403 Forbidden. Another example: canPerform(user, action, resource) function that uses the defined role permissions or ABAC rules (see below). This saves developers from writing repetitive permission logic and centralizes it.
   The RBAC model might define a static mapping of roles to allowed actions (e.g. Admin can invite users, delete tenant data, etc., Member can only view/edit their own data). We will gather common SaaS role patterns to predefine some of this (perhaps via configuration or a default policy).
   Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): To provide more flexibility, ABAC allows defining permissions based on attributes of the user, resource, or environment. Out-of-the-box, supporting full ABAC might be complex, but we aim to include at least the foundation:
   Possibly leverage an existing library (such as Oso or Casbin which are open-source policy engines for Node/Python) to define rules. For example, a rule could be: “Users can view a project if project.ownerId == user.id or if user’s role is Admin” (this mixes user attribute (role) and resource attribute (ownerId)).
   The toolkit might not implement a new policy language from scratch, but rather integrate with one. However, as MVP, we can also implement a simpler version: allow developers to register a set of policy functions or use expressions against context. E.g., provide hooks where a developer can write: Toolkit.authorize("delete_project", (user, project) => user.role == "Admin" || project.ownerId == user.id). The toolkit will then use this function whenever a delete project action is attempted to allow or deny.
   ABAC is particularly useful for specifying conditions beyond just roles – e.g., time-based access, or tier-based (if tenants have tiers, maybe certain features only available if tenant attribute plan=Enterprise, which is an attribute-based check on tenant rather than user).
   For MVP, we will support basic ABAC rules and conditions – primarily focusing on resource ownership and role combinations, as those cover most needs. We must ensure this system is easy to use; if it’s too complex, developers might ignore it. So, good documentation and sensible defaults (like including a rule that “Admins can do everything in their tenant, Users can only do certain things”) will be provided.
   Multi-Tenant Aware Authorization: The combination of RBAC and ABAC should always be evaluated in the context of the current tenant. For example, even if a user has an Admin role in tenant A, if they switch context to tenant B (and perhaps there they are not an Admin), they shouldn’t retain admin privileges in B. The context mechanism ensures we look up the correct role for that user in the active tenant. If a user tries to act on a tenant they don’t belong to, that should be an immediate denial regardless of any roles (they have no role in that tenant).
   Common Auth Provider Integration for Roles: Many applications use external identity systems that already manage user roles or group membership. The toolkit should not mandate re-implementing that. Instead, if a JWT or SAML assertion comes in with roles/permissions, we can map those to the toolkit’s RBAC model. For instance, Auth0’s JWT might have a claim like https://myapp.com/roles: ["Admin"] and possibly a tenant ID claim. Our middleware can extract that and populate the context user’s roles accordingly. We might provide adaptors for popular providers:
   Auth0: Using their Organizations feature, Auth0 tokens can include an org_id (tenant) and roles within that org. The toolkit could have example code or built-in support to use these claims directly.
   Firebase: Firebase Auth has custom claims or one could store role info in Firestore. Possibly less straightforward; we might document how to use our API with Firebase by retrieving user role info from a Firestore lookup in the middleware.
   Okta / Azure AD: These enterprise SSO providers often use group membership to indicate roles. The toolkit might not directly query Okta, but if the app does that and provides roles, our context can accept it.
   Local Auth: If the app uses its own username/password and DB of users, then the toolkit can directly manage roles via the database. We could provide a simple set of SQL scripts or models to create User, Tenant, UserTenantRole tables to store this info if needed.
   Utilities for Managing Roles & Permissions: As part of tenant onboarding (see next section), if we create a new tenant, the toolkit could automatically set up default roles (like one admin user). We might include functions like assignRole(userId, tenantId, roleName) to make it easy for application code to manage membership. Similarly inviteUserToTenant(email, role) could be provided, though sending the actual invite email might be left to the app (we can generate an invite token perhaps).
   Audit and Security: From a security perspective, the toolkit’s enforcement of RBAC/ABAC ensures least privilege – users get the minimum access they need. This reduces insider threat and accidents
   qrvey.com
   . We should log important authorization decisions (especially denials) in case debugging is needed (“user X was prevented from accessing resource Y in tenant Z due to missing permission”). If possible, integrate with the app’s logging framework for consistency.
   Testing and Verification: We will ship with a set of tests or guidelines so developers can verify that their role definitions work as expected. For example, a scenario: Tenant Admin should be able to create a new user for their tenant; a Tenant Member should receive a 403 if they attempt the same operation. We’ll have sample code demonstrating that with our toolkit’s checks.
   Acceptance Criteria: Developers can use the toolkit to define roles and permissions and see them enforced without writing custom logic:
   In a test scenario, a user with a non-privileged role cannot perform an admin-only action (the toolkit’s authz check blocks it). The same user, when given the admin role, can perform it.
   The toolkit allows adding a new custom role (say “Manager”) and assigning specific permissions to it (maybe via a configuration object or code). Then, users with that role see the correct restrictions in effect.
   ABAC example: If configured, a user can only access a record they own unless they have an admin role – this rule should be enforced by a toolkit-provided check (like a method that throws if violation, or returns a filtered query). We can simulate two users in one tenant, one trying to view the other’s resource – and verify it’s forbidden unless a certain attribute condition is met.
   Integration with at least one external auth: e.g., using a JWT with roles, the toolkit correctly populates context roles and respects them. This can be tested by crafting a JWT with different role claims.
   4.4 Tenant Provisioning and Lifecycle Management
   Description: Features to handle the creation, configuration, and deletion of tenants, as well as managing tenant-specific settings or metadata. This set of utilities will make it easy to onboard new organizations and maintain tenant data over time.
   Tenant Creation API: The toolkit will expose a method (or a set of methods) to create a new tenant. This could be something like Toolkit.createTenant(options) that does the following:
   Inserts a new record in a central Tenants registry (if using a SQL/NoSQL DB for metadata) with details like tenant ID (could be auto-generated UUID or a slug), name, domain (if any), creation date, etc.
   If using multiple schemas or databases strategy, it would also set up the necessary infrastructure: e.g., create a new schema or clone a template database for the tenant. Possibly run initial migrations on it. (In single DB mode, this step is not needed beyond maybe seeding initial data.)
   Assign an initial admin user. Often when a new customer signs up, one user (the one who signed up) becomes the admin of that tenant. The function could accept a user identifier or data to associate. If the user exists globally, it links them to this tenant with admin role. If the system creates a new user as part of onboarding (like invite via email), that might be a two-step process – the toolkit can facilitate by creating an “invitation” entry.
   Possibly trigger a welcome/onboarding workflow (this might be more application-specific, e.g., sending emails or provisioning third-party integrations, which might be out of scope for the toolkit itself, but we allow hooks or events).
   The goal is that with a single call, the app developer can programmatically create a tenant with all necessary groundwork done. This is useful for implementing self-service sign-ups or admin consoles to add tenants.
   Tenant Deletion or Archival: Although often not used (SaaS rarely fully deletes tenant data immediately for safety), we should consider providing a safe way to deprovision a tenant:
   Perhaps a Toolkit.archiveTenant(tenantId) that marks a tenant as inactive (so they can no longer log in or access data). It could disable their subdomain route, etc.
   A full deleteTenant could be offered for cases where a tenant needs to be destroyed (with caution!). This would delete or anonymize all their data across tables. If using separate schema/DB, dropping that schema or database is straightforward (but irreversible). If using shared tables, it means deleting rows with that tenantId – we must emphasize caution and maybe provide dry-run or backup suggestions.
   The toolkit might by default not actually delete data, but allow configuration for soft delete vs hard delete of tenants.
   Tenant Metadata & Settings: The library should support storing tenant-specific settings or configuration. For example, each tenant might have a plan (Free, Pro), preferences (like feature flags enabled, branding information, etc.). We can encourage storing this in the Tenants table or a JSON column. The toolkit can provide simple get/set functions for tenant metadata (or just leave it as part of the tenant object returned).
   Example: Toolkit.getTenantConfig(tenantId) returns the metadata for that tenant, which the application can use to adjust behavior. The toolkit itself might use some metadata – e.g., a setting that indicates if the tenant is active or suspended, which our middleware could check to possibly reject requests from suspended tenants.
   User Invitation & Onboarding: A common multi-tenant flow is inviting users to join a tenant:
   The toolkit can provide an inviteUser(email, tenantId, role) utility. This might create an entry (in a invites table or generate a token link) that the application can send via email to the user. When the user signs up through that invite link, the toolkit finalizes by creating the user (if not exists) and assigning them to the tenant with the specified role.
   If using an external auth provider, this process may involve interacting with that provider’s API (for example, Auth0 Orgs allow inviting users via their system). Initially, we likely focus on the scenario where the app manages its own users in a database and use local or JWT auth.
   The toolkit should handle edge cases: inviting an existing user (who already has an account on the platform) to a new tenant vs inviting a totally new user (who will create credentials as part of accepting invite). We might not implement full flow but provide hooks – e.g., developer gets a callback to send email, and a function to call when user accepts to finalize.
   Multi-Tenant Aware Utilities: Additional helper functions for tenant management:
   Listing all tenants (Toolkit.listTenants()), possibly with filters (active only, etc.), for use in admin dashboards or maintenance scripts.
   Switching context programmatically: e.g. if an admin user (with permission to impersonate other tenants) wants to view data in another tenant, a function Toolkit.impersonateTenant(targetTenantId, () => { ... }) could be used. This ties in with context but at a higher privilege. (Laravel’s package even supports user impersonation across tenants
   tenancyforlaravel.com
   ; for us, tenant impersonation might be relevant for platform admins).
   Tenant-aware jobs: as touched earlier, maybe a forEachTenant(callback) that iterates through all tenants and runs a provided function under that tenant’s context – useful for maintenance tasks like sending reports to each tenant, etc.
   Extensibility and Custom Hooks: Recognizing that each application might have custom requirements on tenant creation (e.g., creating default records like a “Welcome Project” or setting up integrations), the toolkit could emit events or allow hooks around these lifecycle events:
   e.g., onTenantCreated, onTenantDeleted events, where the application can plug in custom logic. This event-based architecture is inspired by Laravel’s tenancy package which fires events during tenancy bootstrap
   tenancyforlaravel.com
   . In Node, we can simply provide callbacks in config or use an EventEmitter.
   For example, after a tenant is created, the app might want to create some default data for them; instead of the toolkit hardcoding any domain-specific behavior, we let the app subscribe to a tenant creation event and run its code.
   Acceptance Criteria:
   A developer can use createTenant (or equivalent flow) in a test scenario to programmatically add a new tenant. The result should be that the new tenant is recognized by the system (e.g., the middleware will now allow requests for that tenant’s subdomain or ID, and the database is prepared for their data). If a new user was provided, that user now can log in and is scoped to the new tenant.
   Trying to access a tenant that doesn’t exist returns an error, and trying to create a duplicate (e.g., same subdomain or name) is handled gracefully (with an error or by generating a unique identifier).
   The role of initial user is correctly assigned (the first user becomes admin if that’s the desired logic).
   listTenants returns the newly created tenant among others.
   If applicable, demonstrate that a hook on tenant creation can be caught by a custom handler (e.g., to log or create a sample record).
   For deletion, calling the deletion function should either remove tenant data or mark it. We verify that after deletion, the tenant can no longer log in or retrieve data (requests are rejected). No other tenant’s data is affected.
   Invitation flow (if included): Simulate inviting a user and then accepting the invite, check that the user ends up associated with the tenant. (This might be more of an integration test outside the core library, but we should at least be able to illustrate the mechanism working with our API.)
   4.5 Integration with Authentication & Identity Providers
   Description: Pre-built connectors or guidelines to integrate the multi-tenancy toolkit with common authentication/identity systems. Authentication (auth) is separate from multi-tenancy, but tightly related because the auth system often provides the user identity and sometimes tenant info. Our toolkit will make it easier to connect the dots between auth and tenancy.
   Auth-Agnostic Core: Firstly, the core of the toolkit will not be tied to a specific authentication library. Developers might use Passport.js, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) manually, Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito, or others. The toolkit’s tenant resolution middleware can be placed after authentication middleware in the request pipeline, so that the user is already identified. Then we can use the authenticated user info for tenant logic (e.g., check their tenant memberships).
   Common Patterns Support: We will provide documentation and possibly small adapter modules for patterns like:
   JWT with Tenant Claim: If using JWTs (e.g. OAuth2 access tokens or ID tokens) that include a claim like tenant_id or org, we’ll show how to configure the toolkit to use that. Possibly an option in our middleware like fromTokenClaim: 'tenant_id'.
   Multiple Tenant Memberships: If a user can belong to multiple tenants, the auth process needs to convey which tenant they are currently accessing. This might be through the subdomain (user goes to a specific subdomain to log in) or via an organization switch in UI which then includes a tenant context in requests. We will support both: subdomain case is straightforward (URL dictates tenant and user’s token just proves identity), whereas for a single domain app, the frontend must indicate desired tenant (header or token claim). Our toolkit could allow a query param or header ?tenant=<id> at login time to set context – however, that can be risky if not validated. Likely, we rely on either subdomains or tokens that are issued per tenant (some IdPs can issue a token that’s tied to a specific org).
   Session-Based Auth: If using session cookies (typical in server-rendered apps), the server can store the current tenant in the session after user logs in. The toolkit’s middleware could then read req.session.tenantId if present. We should cover this scenario as well in docs or config.
   Auth Provider SDK Integration: For some providers, we might include helper functions:
   Auth0: The toolkit could include an option to validate Auth0 tokens (though Auth0 provides middleware already). More useful might be functions to call Auth0 Management API for organization operations. However, since our toolkit is primarily backend, we probably won’t directly call external APIs, but we can facilitate mapping Auth0’s concept to ours. For example, if a developer uses Auth0 Organizations, they might not need our invite system at all – Auth0 handles user invites to org. Our toolkit should accommodate that by allowing the developer to plug in their own user/role management or by using an optional “Auth0 mode” where tenant and membership data comes from Auth0. This might be advanced and possibly out-of-scope for MVP, but we’ll lay groundwork by not making assumptions that all users/roles are local.
   Okta/Azure AD: Similar to Auth0, if using these, they often treat each tenant as a group or separate tenant concept in Azure AD B2C. We likely won’t have native integration in v1, but will ensure it’s possible to use toolkit in such environment by writing custom resolvers. Possibly, if Azure AD uses separate directories as tenants, our toolkit might not be needed in the same way (that’s a different model).
   Single Sign-On (SSO) and SAML: Many enterprise customers use SAML SSO, where user logs in via corporate identity. In those cases, tenant is often determined by the domain or the IdP used. E.g., a particular SAML endpoint is configured per tenant. Our toolkit can’t directly handle SAML, but if the result of SAML login is that we know which tenant the user is from (we might link IdP metadata to a tenant in our DB), then we integrate that into the tenant context when user arrives.
   We might document how to map an IdP-initiated login to a tenant in the system (like storing an IdP identifier in tenant metadata).
   This is more of a documentation/guidance task, ensuring enterprise auth is not incompatible with the toolkit.
   Minimal Built-in Auth (Optional): While not a core goal (since many will use existing solutions), we might include a very minimal user authentication for demonstration or testing (e.g., an in-memory or simple user/pass check just to try out multi-tenancy). But likely we just focus on integration and provide a sample app that uses e.g. Passport local strategy or JWT for demonstration.
   Ensuring Security: The integration points must ensure that authentication is fully completed before allowing access to data. The toolkit itself might perform a check: if a route requires a certain role and the user is not authenticated or context lacks user, it should reject early. We should encourage usage such that developers authenticate, then resolve tenant, then authorize (in that order). This aligns with typical middleware ordering: first verify the user’s identity (and perhaps load their roles), then determine tenant (which may partly come from identity), then enforce permissions.
   Documentation & Examples: Provide examples in documentation for integrating with:
   Passport.js (for local or JWT strategies),
   JWT verification middleware (e.g., express-jwt or similar) with a custom claim,
   A brief how-to for Auth0’s Node SDK with Organizations,
   Mention of at least one Python scenario (maybe FastAPI with JWT in future docs, preparing for cross-language usage).
   Acceptance Criteria:
   In a sample application using the toolkit and an auth mechanism (for instance, JWT-based auth), a user’s request goes through auth and tenant resolution and ends up with the correct context. If the JWT has tenant info, the toolkit uses it; if not, but the route is on a subdomain, the toolkit finds the tenant and possibly validates that the authenticated user is part of that tenant.
   If an authenticated user tries to access a tenant they don’t belong to, the toolkit should deny access (e.g., not find a valid membership, hence treat it as unauthorized).
   We can demonstrate switching tenant context: e.g., a user with access to two tenants can send a request to tenant A’s endpoint vs tenant B’s endpoint and, with the same JWT (assuming it has no hard tenant binding), the toolkit will isolate them based on subdomain or an explicit switch. Alternatively, the user obtains separate tokens for each tenant (like Auth0 org tokens) and the toolkit handles each properly.
   For an external provider scenario (if tested): e.g. using Auth0 Org, after login the user’s token has org_id, and our toolkit correctly uses that to set tenant context (the tenant was pre-provisioned with that org ID perhaps).
   The integration should not add excessive complexity or failure points – e.g., if the user’s token is missing expected info, we handle it gracefully (maybe require that the app supplies tenant info by some means, otherwise return an error telling that configuration is needed).
   4.6 Developer Experience and Flexibility
   (This section ensures non-functional requirements around usability, configuration, and openness of the toolkit.)
   Simple Installation: The toolkit will be delivered as an npm package (e.g. @saaskit/multitenancy or similar). Installing it and importing should give access to all needed components. We’ll avoid requiring complex setup steps. For example, after installation, a minimal setup might be:
   typescript
   Copy
   Edit
   import { TenancyMiddleware, MultiTenantPrismaClient } from "@saaskit/multitenancy";
   app.use(TenancyMiddleware({ type: 'subdomain' }));
   // ... later
   const projects = await prisma.project.findMany(); // Already tenant-scoped by middleware integration
   Configuration can be passed as an object or via a config file. We will also support environment variables for certain settings if appropriate (though most config is code-level).
   Clear Documentation: The toolkit will come with comprehensive documentation including:
   Getting Started guide (with a basic example app setup, likely using Express and one ORM).
   Explanation of core concepts (tenant identification, data filtering, role management).
   How-to guides for common tasks (e.g., "How to use with Prisma", "How to implement multi-tenancy with subdomains vs with headers", "Integrating with Auth0" etc.).
   API reference (for all public classes/methods in the library).
   We may also include a reference architecture diagram showing how the pieces fit together for visual learners.
   TypeScript Support: Since the library is written in TypeScript, it will include type definitions. This helps catch integration mistakes (like trying to call a toolkit method with wrong params) and improves IDE experience. We will design the API to be type-friendly (using generics where needed, e.g., maybe wrapping Prisma’s client types to produce tenant-bound versions).
   Modular Design: The toolkit should allow opting into just the parts needed. For instance, if someone only wants the database filtering but not the RBAC part (maybe they have their own authz system), they should be able to use that independently. We can structure the package so that components like “TenantManager”, “AuthZ (RBAC/ABAC)”, “ORM adapters” are somewhat separate modules internally. A monolithic approach where everything is tightly coupled could deter adoption by those who don’t need all features or want to use a different approach for one aspect.
   Configurability: Provide a central configuration object or file where developers can tweak behavior:
   For example, define the tenant ID field name if not tenantId.
   Toggle features like “enforce roles” on/off (maybe some simpler apps initially might not use roles).
   Choose the multi-tenancy mode (single DB vs multi-DB) if multiple are supported.
   Provide secrets or keys if needed for integration (though likely the toolkit itself doesn’t need secrets except maybe if it interacts with auth provider APIs).
   Logging and Debugging: Include built-in logging (using a logging library or simply console with debug levels) to help developers debug issues:
   e.g., during development, the toolkit can log “Tenant resolved: X”, “Query modified to include tenantId”, “Access denied for user Y on action Z” etc., at a DEBUG level. This greatly aids in understanding the toolkit’s actions.
   We can allow enabling verbose logging via config for troubleshooting. In production, these can be turned off or logged through the app’s logger.
   Testing Utilities: Provide some helpers to make writing tests for multi-tenant logic easier:
   e.g., a way to simulate a request with a given tenant context in unit tests (since normally context is set via middleware in an actual server).
   Perhaps a memory-store implementation of context for tests, or the ability to call certain functions with a tenantId manually.
   If we provide an in-memory variant of the ORM or a dummy repository, that could help, but likely out-of-scope. Instead, at least show examples of how to set up tests (maybe using something like supertest to simulate HTTP requests through the middleware).
   Performance and Overhead: The toolkit should be designed with minimal overhead. We will conduct basic benchmarks to ensure that adding the toolkit doesn’t significantly degrade request throughput or latency. Node’s AsyncLocalStorage has some overhead, but it’s generally acceptable for web applications (and unavoidable for context management). Query modifications are fast operations relative to I/O. We should document any performance implications and possibly allow turning off features if not needed (for example, if ABAC rules are complex, maybe that check can be skipped if the app chooses not to use ABAC).
   Open Source Governance: As an open-source project, we will:
   Choose a permissive license (MIT or Apache-2.0, to be decided) to encourage usage and contributions.
   Host the code on GitHub (for example) and include contribution guidelines (so others can add support for more ORMs, or improve features).
   Set up basic CI to run tests for pull requests.
   Possibly create a community chat or discussion forum (GitHub Discussions or a Discord channel) for users to seek help and suggest features.
   Mark certain advanced features as potential future enhancements, inviting community involvement (e.g., Python version, multi-DB support might be labeled as “help wanted” or planned).
   Open-Core Potential: Mention that while the toolkit is fully open-source for core functionality, the team might develop premium plugins or services in the future (for example, a hosted management dashboard, or priority support, or extra compliance features). However, the core library as described in MVP will be free to use. This is to be transparent about project direction (some users might be concerned if it’ll stay maintained if it’s free – an open-core model can assure them there’s a business model backing it, while still not locking them in).
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Developer feedback from an initial beta should indicate the toolkit was straightforward to integrate by following documentation, without requiring constant support.
   The library should build and generate type definitions correctly. When imported in a TypeScript project, IDE autocompletion works for its functions.
   Running an example app with the toolkit enabled shows that it doesn’t crash and logs expected debug info about tenant operations.
   A new contributor (not on the core team) should be able to read the docs and set up the project and run tests, indicating our open-source repo is developer-friendly.
   Configuration toggles work: for instance, turning off a feature like ABAC (if such toggle exists) indeed stops evaluating those rules (tested by setting and seeing behavior change).
   Modular import test: one should be able to import { TenantManager } from 'toolkit' and use it without necessarily invoking other parts, if they choose a custom integration.
5. Architecture and Technical Design Considerations
   (This section describes how the system might be structured under the hood, to meet the above requirements.) Overall Architecture: The Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit will function as a library integrated into a host application. It is not a standalone service – rather, it enhances the host app’s architecture by introducing a Tenant Management Layer. Key components of the architecture include:
   Tenant Manager / Core Module: Responsible for managing tenant data (creation, retrieval, deletion) and providing tenant context. Likely implemented as a class TenantManager with methods createTenant, getTenant, listTenants, etc., and an internal store or DB access for tenant metadata. This module interfaces with the application’s database to store tenant info. For flexibility, we might allow the host app to supply a data store implementation (for example, if they want to use their own models or a different DB for tenant registry). By default, we’ll assume a relational DB table Tenants or a Mongo collection for tenant info.
   Middleware/Context Module: A set of middleware functions (Express/NestJS, etc.) and a context propagation mechanism. Underneath, this uses Node’s AsyncLocalStorage to tie a tenant (and user) context to each incoming request. The design might involve a singleton instance of an AsyncLocalStorage store that all parts of toolkit import and use to get/set context. This way, the ORM adapters or authz checks can all retrieve currentTenantId or currentUser from a single source without needing explicit threading through.
   One must consider that some ORMs (like Prisma) run queries outside the request call stack (e.g., in their own internal threads or as promises). AsyncLocalStorage generally works with the async call chain, but if an ORM uses a connection pool with its own callbacks, we’ll test to ensure context is not lost. We might need to tie into ORM-specific context passing if needed.
   ORM Adapters: Separate sub-modules or classes for each supported ORM/ODM:
   PrismaAdapter: Provides the prisma.$use middleware to enforce tenant ID on queries. Also possibly extends the generated Prisma client with convenience methods (maybe not needed; middleware might suffice). Could also handle connecting to different databases if needed (e.g., instantiate multiple PrismaClient for multi-DB).
   SequelizeAdapter: Exports a function or Sequelize plugin to apply a default scope or hook. Might also provide a base Model class to extend.
   MongooseAdapter: Exports a plugin that attaches to schemas for auto-filters, or a base schema. Possibly provides a utility to get a model scoped to a tenant.
   Each adapter will likely require the developer to invoke it with their ORM instance. For example: PrismaAdapter.enable(prisma, { tenantField: 'tenantId' }) or SequelizeAdapter.init(sequelize) etc. The adapter will then utilize the Tenant Context to modify behavior. This design keeps the core toolkit decoupled from any specific ORM – if you don’t use Prisma, you don’t pay the cost for that code (perhaps we separate them into packages or at least modules).
   AuthZ (Authorization) Module: Contains logic for RBAC/ABAC. Possibly includes:
   Data structures for roles/permissions (could be in-memory config or stored in DB depending on scale – likely fine to keep in memory or in code as configuration since typically roles aren’t too dynamic at runtime).
   Functions like checkPermission(user, action, resource) which consult the roles/policies.
   If integrating a policy engine (like Oso or Casbin), this module might initialize that engine with policies. Alternatively, we manually evaluate rules defined by developer.
   Also possibly a data model or at least an interface for UserTenantRole relation if not using external auth. We might integrate with the tenant manager such that createTenant can also set up a user with role.
   Utilities Module: Miscellaneous helpers – e.g., for caching (key prefixer), for file storage path generation, for running tasks per tenant, etc. This can be a grab bag of opt-in functions that assist multi-tenant scenarios beyond core data access.
   Configuration & Initialization: We will likely have a function initializeTenancy(config) that the application calls early (during app startup). This sets global configurations (like connecting the context mechanism, possibly syncs the tenant metadata store, etc.). In a Node environment, global singletons or static classes might be used for some parts (like one AsyncLocalStorage instance, one config object). We must be careful to support potentially multiple instances in testing or multi-process scenarios (though typically one instance per process).
   Storage Considerations:
   We anticipate using the application’s database for storing tenants and roles. We need to provide migration or DDL instructions for setting up required tables if any (e.g., a tenants table and maybe user_tenant_roles table). If the app is using an ORM, we could provide entities or models that they can import or copy. We might not directly run migrations (since we aim to be ORM-agnostic for core metadata), but providing SQL schema snippets or a Prisma model definition in docs would help. Some developers might not want an extra dependency; others might appreciate an automated way – we can consider shipping a small SQL schema or even an API like TenantManager.ensureSchema() that checks/creates necessary tables (if using a direct DB connection).
   In NoSQL context, tenant metadata could be just a collection. We keep it simple: maybe tenant ID and name are all that’s mandatory, plus optional fields.
   Scalability: The architecture needs to handle moderate scale: e.g., hundreds of concurrent requests across tens of tenants. Using AsyncLocalStorage is known to have some overhead but is generally okay at these scales (the cost is a few microseconds per async operation). If an application is extremely high throughput, they might opt not to use context but pass tenant in function arguments (which they could still do manually if they prefer). We assume the convenience outweighs the small perf hit for our target scenario.
   Memory overhead: storing context per request is ephemeral and should clear after request. Ensure no memory leaks by properly exiting the context.
   The central tenant registry likely is small (if thousands of tenants, that’s still not huge to keep some cache of). We might implement caching for tenant lookups (when a subdomain comes in, we may cache the mapping of subdomain to tenantId to avoid DB hit on every request).
   If multi-DB mode, we need to manage potentially many DB connections. We might limit or allow pooling per tenant. This can become heavy if tenant count is large. In MVP, focusing on single DB avoids that complexity; we will document the trade-off for those wanting separate DBs.
   Example Flow (HTTP Request): A brief rundown – When a request arrives:
   App’s auth middleware runs: authenticates user, perhaps attaches user object to req or a JWT payload to context.
   Toolkit’s tenant middleware runs: uses config to parse tenant (from subdomain or header or token). It might query the TenantManager if needed (e.g., subdomain “acme” -> find tenant in DB). It then calls AsyncLocalStorage.run() to establish a context and store { tenantId: X, user: Y, roles: [...] }. From here on, any code can call something like getCurrentTenant() which internally does asyncLocalStorage.getStore()?.tenantId.
   The request proceeds to the route handler or business logic. When a database query is made via an integrated ORM, our adapter intercepts it:
   For Prisma: our middleware sees the query, gets the tenantId from AsyncLocalStorage, modifies the query.
   For Sequelize: either the model’s default scope includes tenantId which is already set from context, or a hook runs now to append it.
   For any raw queries or non-integrated parts, the developer must manually use our context (we’ll warn about that).
   If the route had an authorization requirement (say an admin-only route), our provided decorator or check would run, see user’s role from context, and decide to allow or throw 403.
   The rest of the app logic executes (which ideally doesn’t need to know about multi-tenancy at every step because we handled it centrally).
   Response is returned. When AsyncLocalStorage scope exits (end of request tick), context is gone.
   Meanwhile, if any event triggers cross-tenant operations (say a scheduled job calls forEachTenant), the toolkit will fetch all tenants from TenantManager, and for each one, set context and execute the given callback function, one tenant at a time (or maybe in parallel, but isolated).
   Technology Stack & Dependencies:
   Node.js (runtime, requirement for AsyncLocalStorage which is available in Node 14+; we’ll require at least Node LTS version that supports it).
   TypeScript for development (compiled to JS for distribution).
   Dependencies might include:
   For context: no external dependency needed (AsyncLocalStorage is built-in).
   For RBAC/ABAC: possibly Casbin or Oso if we decide to integrate. Alternatively, we implement a lightweight rule engine ourselves. Casbin has Node support and can do RBAC/ABAC with policies, which could be overkill or a quick solution. We need to evaluate the complexity vs benefit. For MVP, a simple internal check system may suffice (with option to swap out later).
   For database connectivity in TenantManager: We might use the same ORM that the app uses or allow injecting a DB client. Perhaps simplest is to require the app to supply a way to query the tenants store (so we don’t enforce an ORM for that). E.g., if using Prisma, the developer might use their Prisma to manage tenants too. Or we could include a lightweight ORM like objection or knex for internal queries. But adding a heavy dep might not be ideal. Leaning towards making it app’s responsibility: e.g., TenantManager.configure({ dataStore: ... }) where dataStore is an interface we define (with methods like getTenantById, getTenantByDomain, createTenantRecord), and we provide a default implementation for simple cases.
   No major other dependencies expected except maybe a logging library or types package.
   Cross-Platform (Node/Python): While MVP is Node, we might design it in a way conceptually portable. For instance, the overall approach (middleware, context, query filtering) could later be reimplemented in Python (perhaps as a Django or FastAPI extension). We won’t worry about Python code now, but we keep the design documented so similar ideas can be applied (like thread-local storage for context in Python, using SQLAlchemy events for query filtering, etc.). Possibly the open-core idea could be a multi-language set of libraries under one brand in the long run.
   Risk & Mitigation in Architecture:
   Ensuring that all parts of the application honor the tenant context is challenging. If a developer uses a part of their stack that we don’t have an adapter for (say a raw SQL call or another ORM), that could bypass isolation. We mitigate by:
   Clear documentation of supported integrations.
   Provide manual guidelines for unsupported cases (like “if you use raw queries, always call this utility to add tenant filter or use our context to get tenantId and include it”).
   Possibly a development mode check: for example, we might instrument the DB client in dev to assert that any query without a tenantId in the WHERE clause is logged or flagged (though doing that generally is complex and maybe not foolproof).
   Async context loss: If some asynchronous flows aren’t tracked by AsyncLocalStorage (e.g., certain older callback libraries), context might not propagate. We will test common frameworks to ensure compatibility (Express, etc., are generally fine). If issues, document and possibly suggest using promises/async which do propagate.
   Performance: If the added complexity causes slowdowns, we might allow disabling some parts. E.g., if ABAC rules are too slow, dev can rely on just RBAC which is quicker to evaluate. Or allow caching of authZ decisions for a request if it’s called repeatedly.
   Security of overrides: If we allow any “override context” or impersonation features, ensure they are either restricted (only admin of entire system can use) or clearly documented as dangerous. Possibly, include something like “debug mode impersonation only”.
   Diagrams: (In documentation, we would include diagrams like request flow or module interaction. For this PRD text format, we omit actual image, but one could imagine a flowchart illustrating the above request flow.)
6. MVP Scope and Deliverables
   Based on the requirements above, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit will include the following deliverables:
   Core Tenant Context & Middleware: Implementation of tenant resolution for Express (as it’s widely used; possibly compatible with Connect so it works in Express, NestJS, etc.). AsyncLocalStorage-based context storage. This includes at least support for subdomain-based and header/token-based identification out-of-the-box. Deliverable: a set of middleware functions and context APIs with documentation on how to use them.
   ORM Integrations (Initial Set): Adapters for Prisma and Sequelize (since those were explicitly mentioned) and Mongoose (due to its popularity in Node). Each adapter tested with basic use cases (CRUD operations are properly scoped). Deliverable: Code for these adapters and usage docs (e.g. “How to integrate with Prisma Client” etc.).
   Data Model & Management: A basic schema for tenant and membership. Likely provide a SQL example and a Mongoose schema for how to represent tenants and user-tenants. Not enforcing a single approach but giving one that works for the included features. Deliverable: a section in docs for “Setting up your database for multi-tenancy” with example migrations or models, and corresponding code in the library to interface with that (like TenantManager uses those models).
   RBAC/ABAC System: Provide the ability to define roles and permissions, and enforce them via toolkit functions. MVP will include at least role checks (admin vs user) and possibly one example of attribute rule (like owner can edit their own resource). Deliverable: an API for authorization checks (Toolkit.allow(...) or middleware to protect routes) and documentation on configuring roles/permissions.
   Tenant Onboarding Utilities: Provide createTenant and inviteUser basic implementation for a common use-case (with assumption of local user storage). It should handle adding a tenant record and linking a user as admin. Deliverable: those functions and tests for them. (If integration with external auth is not fully automated, we at least include the hooks for it.)
   Developer Docs & Example App: A crucial part of MVP is extensive documentation and a working example. We will deliver a sample repository (or at least included in docs) that shows a simple Express app using the toolkit: two endpoints (one public, one protected), a couple of data models (e.g., a Product that is tenant-scoped), demonstrating multi-tenant queries and role enforcement. This example will serve as a template for new users. Deliverable: “Getting Started” tutorial and maybe a link to a GitHub repo with example code.
   Open Source Repo Setup: The project will be on GitHub with a proper README (which might be a trimmed version of this PRD’s highlights for potential contributors/users), license file, contribution guide, and issue templates. The initial release (v0.1 or v1.0) will be tagged and released on npm for easy consumption. Deliverable: public repository and npm package with versioned release.
   Testing: The MVP will include a test suite covering major functionality: e.g., a test that simulates two tenants and ensures data isolation, a test for role permissions, etc. Also, integration tests for each supported ORM (maybe using SQLite or an in-memory DB for simplicity in CI).
   Feedback Loop: Although not a “feature”, as part of MVP we will have a plan to collect early feedback (maybe via GitHub discussions or issues). Any critical fixes or minor enhancements (like supporting an obvious additional use-case) might be addressed in quick follow-up patch releases.
   Out of Scope for MVP (Future Work):
   Full multi-database support (beyond basic architecture readiness) – advanced use-cases like seamless support for separate DB per tenant might come later.
   Deep integration with external identity providers (we will support them conceptually, but we won’t, for example, call Auth0 Management API for you; that remains app logic, aided by our hooks).
   Tenant-specific customizations beyond data (for instance, theming, feature flags – those can be built using the toolkit’s metadata support, but we won’t implement a full feature-flag system).
   UI components: the toolkit is backend-focused. We will not provide UI widgets; the developers will build their admin UI or onboarding UI using our backend APIs.
   Python version: not in MVP, but likely on the roadmap once Node version stabilizes, given Python was mentioned as another ecosystem lacking such a toolkit. A similar library for Django or FastAPI could reuse the concepts here.
   Enterprise features like audit logging out-of-the-box, rate limiting per tenant, etc., might be future adds or part of an “enterprise extension”. MVP will concentrate on core functionality first and foremost.
7. Future Enhancements
   Looking beyond the MVP, there are several areas where the Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit can expand and improve:
   Support for Additional ORMs/Frameworks: After Prisma, Sequelize, and Mongoose, we can add integration for other popular data libraries:
   TypeORM (for those using it in Node, especially with NestJS).
   Knex (for lower-level query building).
   For Python (when we get there): SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, etc.
   Also, consider GraphQL context integration (e.g., if using Apollo Server, providing a plugin to add tenant info to GraphQL context).
   Advanced Role/Policy Management: Introduce a full policy engine if needed, or a UI for managing roles and permissions per tenant (this could be part of an open-core premium offering – e.g., an admin dashboard that lets a site owner configure roles and permissions without code). Also possibly implement support for relationship-based access control (ReBAC), which is an emerging model (like Facebook’s graph-based permissions) – might be overkill, but some enterprise apps might want to model access via relationships rather than just roles.
   Multi-Database & Sharding Capabilities: Fully implement multiple tenancy models:
   Easy configuration to choose isolating each tenant in their own schema or database. Possibly integration with database clustering or cloud databases for automated provisioning.
   Tools to migrate a tenant from one database to another (for load balancing tenants).
   Support for horizontal scaling like using Citus (Postgres extension) for sharding tenants transparently
   frontegg.com
   frontegg.com
   .
   Monitoring & Analytics: Provide hooks or built-in collectors for per-tenant metrics (like number of requests, query performance segregated by tenant, etc.). This data helps developers or DevOps to identify “noisy neighbor” issues
   frontegg.com
   frontegg.com
   and potentially move a heavy tenant to its own DB. We might offer, in a premium version, a monitoring dashboard for tenant usage.
   Security Enhancements: Continuously improve security features:
   Possibly integrate scanning tools to detect any missing tenant filters in code (static analysis).
   Add end-to-end encryption options for tenant data (some apps encrypt data with tenant-specific keys for extra isolation).
   Automated tests or even runtime checks that validate isolation (maybe by deliberately trying a cross-tenant access in a safe test mode).
   More robust compliance support (like easier data export for one tenant, or per-tenant encryption keys).
   Tenant-specific Customization Support: Facilitating features that let each tenant have custom behavior/config:
   e.g., feature flags per tenant, custom domains (already partly covered), custom themes. Not the core of toolkit, but we can provide patterns or support (like serving static assets from tenant-specific directories, etc.).
   Maybe integration with billing: not exactly multi-tenancy itself, but closely related for SaaS – an “open-core” possibility is providing a billing module that knows about tenants and usage.
   Cross-Language and Platform: As mentioned, a Python version or even a cross-language standard. We might consider a core that’s defined in a language-neutral way (perhaps using something like WASM or just parallel implementations). Given the initial focus, likely we’ll do a Python port separately, sharing lessons learned.
   Community Contributions: Encourage contributions for niche needs – e.g., someone might contribute a CouchDB multi-tenancy adapter, or support for serverless environments specifically (where multi-tenancy might have different considerations).
   Open-Core Additions: If pursuing an open-core model, identify which features could be premium:
   Possibly a Multi-Tenant Admin Dashboard (a web UI to manage tenants, roles, etc., which uses our library under the hood).
   Audit logs or analytics as mentioned, if delivered as a service.
   Managed hosting of a key management service for per-tenant encryption, etc.
   However, keep core promise: the ability to isolate and manage tenants in code remains free and open.
   The roadmap for these enhancements will depend on user feedback from the MVP. The immediate next likely step after MVP is ensuring stability and adding any missing pieces that early adopters find crucial. For example, if many request TypeORM support or a feature flag integration, those might get priority.
8. Risks and Mitigations
   Risk: Developer Adoption and Integration Difficulty – If the toolkit is too complex to integrate or requires too many changes to existing code, developers might shy away. Mitigation: Emphasize making the integration as drop-in as possible. Provide excellent documentation and a migration guide for existing projects. Maintain flexibility so it can adapt to various project structures. Risk: Security Flaws – A flaw in the toolkit (e.g., failing to enforce tenant filter in a corner case) could lead to severe data leaks. Mitigation: Extensive testing and possibly external security audit for the toolkit. Take inspiration from known secure patterns (like the Laravel package, which has been used by many) and incorporate community feedback. Make security considerations very explicit in docs and encourage peer review (open source advantage). Risk: Performance Overhead – The additional middleware and query wrapping might add latency or resource usage. Mitigation: Test performance and optimize critical paths in the code. Provide tuning options (like turning off debug logs, disabling features not used). Also communicate the overhead vs benefits clearly; for most apps the overhead will be negligible compared to database and network times. Risk: Scope Creep – Multi-tenancy touches many aspects (auth, data, deployment). There is a risk of the project trying to do too much and becoming unmanageably large. Mitigation: Stick to core objectives in MVP. Use modular design so even if feature set grows, it’s compartmentalized. Leverage existing libraries when possible (don’t write everything from scratch if a well-tested lib can be integrated for a sub-component). Risk: Compatibility – Need to ensure compatibility across Node versions, database types, and other libraries. Mitigation: Use standard features (Node LTS), test with multiple databases (Postgres, MySQL, Mongo as primary targets). Provide fallbacks if some feature (like AsyncLocalStorage) isn’t available or reliable in an environment (maybe use a manual context passing alternative in such rare cases or require a polyfill). Risk: Open Source Sustainability – After initial release, maintaining the project and responding to issues requires commitment. Mitigation: Plan for an active maintenance schedule. Possibly form a small team or get community maintainers involved. If open-core, funding can support long-term work. Make sure documentation reduces trivial questions by being thorough.
9. Conclusion
   The Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit is poised to fill a significant gap in the Node.js and Python ecosystems by providing a unified, security-focused solution for multi-tenancy. By learning from successful patterns in other frameworks (Laravel, .NET, etc.) and addressing the pain points developers have voiced

   , this toolkit will make it dramatically easier to build SaaS applications that serve multiple customers securely within one codebase. In summary, the toolkit will deliver:
   Standardization – a common way to handle tenant identification and data isolation, reducing custom one-off code.
   Security – confidence that each tenant’s data and actions are properly isolated, with guardrails to prevent data leaks

   .
   Developer Productivity – pre-built integrations and APIs mean developers can launch multi-tenant apps faster and with fewer bugs, focusing on features unique to their business rather than multi-tenancy plumbing.
   Flexibility – a solution that adapts to different app architectures (various ORMs, auth systems, database choices), ensuring broad usability.
   By achieving these, the Multi-Tenant SaaS Toolkit will help developers avoid the tedium and risks of reinventing multi-tenancy, and instead leverage a robust, open-source foundation for their SaaS platforms. With an MVP delivering all core functionality and a vision for future enhancements (including an open-core model for advanced needs), we aim to foster a community around this toolkit and make multi-tenant architecture more accessible to all Node/TypeScript (and eventually Python) developers. Success for this project will be seen when developers can confidently say that adding multi-tenancy to their app was straightforward and worry-free, thanks to our toolkit – transforming what used to be an onerous challenge into a solved problem.
